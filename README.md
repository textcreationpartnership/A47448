##Content Summary##

#####Front#####

1. THE INTRODUCTION.

#####Body#####

1. CHAP. I. Wherein it is proved, That Baptism is not Sprinkling nor Pouring of Water on the Face, nor Dipping of the Head only; But that it is Dipping or Plunging of the whole Body under Water.

1. CHAP. II. Wherein Mr. Shutes Reply to Mr. Hercules Collins Answer about habitual Faith is considered, detected and clearly refuted; proving that Infants are not required to believe, nor are they (without a miracle) capable so to do, nor are they intended in those places of Scripture that Enjoyns Faith on the Adult.

1. CHAP. III. Proving that Infants of Believers, as such, are not in the Covenant of Grace God made with Abraham; and that there was a twofold Covenant made with Abraham, one that peculiarly referred to his Natural Seed, as such; and the other to his Spiritual Seed, as such; with a full Answer and Confutation of what Mr. Shute hath said in his last reply to Mr. Collins, and to Benjamin Keach, in his Treatise, The Ax lay'd to the Root, about the Covenant of Grace, and that of Circumcision.

1. CHAP. IV. Wherein Mr. Shutes arguments to prove our Churches no Churches, and our Baptism a counterfeit, are examined and answered.

    _ Arguments to prove that those Churches who are gathered by Faith and Repentance, and upon the profession of Faith are Baptized (which are called Anabaptists) are true Churches of Christ▪ which Mr. Shute den•es so to be.

1. CHAP. V. Containing an account of some of Mr. Shutes onseemly, Scoffing and opprobrious language cast upon Mr. Collins, and my self together, with his false and abusive representation of us, and of several places of Holy Scripture; with his Impertinences, Inconsistences and self-contradictions, as also those abuses he hath cast on the Baptized Congregations, in which Rom. 11. 16. is explained, viz. if the Root be Holy so are the Branches. And if some of the Branches were broken off, &c.

    _ Mr. Sh•••s's abusive and false Representations of us, and false Interpretation of several places of Holy Scripture, and Gods Holy Ordinance of Dipping Believers in the Name, &c.

    _ An Account of some of Mr. Shute's Impertinences, Inconsistences and Self-contradictions.

1. AN APPENDIX; BEING A Reply to Mr. Shute's last single Sheet, in Answer to Mr. Collins's half Sheet; wherein the Covenant of Circumcision, &c. and free Promise of Grace, God made to Abraham, are further and distinctly opened; shewing how they differ from each other.

    _ An Account of Mr. Shutes scurrilous language as to the rest of this Sheet: I shall only make some remarks on his hard reproachful and Opprobrious words and abuse of Scripture.

#####Back#####

1. ERRATA.

1. POSTSCRIPT, Containing several Arguments (to disprove Pedo-Baptism, and to prove Believers only the Subjects thereof:) For Mr. Gyles Shute to Answer.
